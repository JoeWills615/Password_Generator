# Password_Generator
VCB_HW_03


The assignment was to properly code a password generator that would announce to the end user certain prompts for the conditions that must be met to make a proper password. These conditions include amount of characters and which characters would be used. Each time the end user made a selection the program would advance or prompt the end user to make another selection until a proper password was created.
